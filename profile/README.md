"Badass Ravi Kumar" is an upcoming Hindi action-comedy musical film directed by Keith Gomes, featuring Himesh Reshammiya reprising his role as Ravi Kumar from the 2014 film "The Xposé." The movie is scheduled for release on February 7, 2025. 

As of now, there are no official reviews available since the film has not yet been released. However, the recently released trailer has garnered attention for its distinctive style and content. According to The Indian Express, the film is being touted as a retro-action musical, with Himesh Reshammiya and Prabhu Deva amplifying the 'cringe' factor in an '80s-type' film. 

Koimoi describes the trailer as potentially the "most honest trailer of the decade," suggesting that the film might be a spoof of 1980s cinema, reminiscent of cult classics like "Gunda."
